    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe unbaked pie crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Raspberry Topping</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package frozen raspberries</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Cream Filling</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Roll out pie crust and gently lay inside a 9-inch pie dish. Lightly press the dough into the corners and
            sides of the dish to help prevent shrinkage. Prick the bottom of the pie crust a few times with a fork. Line
            the bottom with foil or parchment and fill with dried beans or pie weights. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove lining and beans or weights and continue baking until
            crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Let cool completely. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a medium saucepan. Stir in raspberries, water, and lemon
            juice. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir
            in butter and vanilla extract. Set aside to cool. </li>
        <li> Pour heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed
            until stiff peaks form. Transfer to another bowl. </li>
        <li> Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in the stand mixer bowl. Switch to the paddle
            attachment and beat until well combined, about 2 minutes. Fold in whipped cream and sour cream until evenly
            incorporated. </li>
        <li> Spread cream filling into the cooled pie crust. Top with the cooled raspberry topping. Refrigerate pie
            until thoroughly chilled, 2 hours to overnight. </li>
    </ol>
