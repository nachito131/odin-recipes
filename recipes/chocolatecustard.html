    <h5>Ingredients</h5>

    <h6>Pie Crust</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold shortening, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ice water, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Pie Filling</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) bar semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Whipped Cream Topping</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare crust: Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor 3 to 4 times or until combined. Add butter
            and shortening and pulse 10 to 12 times or until mixture resembles coarse meal. Drizzle 4 tablespoons ice
            water over mixture; pulse 5 to 6 times or until dough clumps together, adding up to 1 tablespoon water, 1
            teaspoon at a time, if necessary. Gently shape dough into a flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for
            30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle (about 1/8 inch thick) on a floured surface. Fit into a 9-inch pie plate;
            turn edges under and crimp. Prick the bottom and sides with a fork. Line pastry with parchment paper, and
            fill with pie weights or dried beans. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Remove pie weights and parchment paper and continue to bake until
            lightly browned and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack and cool while preparing filling.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare filling: Whisk together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a large saucepan. Whisk together
            heavy cream, milk, and egg yolks in a medium bowl until completely blended. Gradually whisk egg mixture into
            sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, just until mixture begins to boil, 6 to 8 minutes. Cook for 1
            more minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and whisk in semisweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate,
            butter, and vanilla until chocolate and butter have melted and mixture is completely smooth. </li>
        <li>Spread filling in the cooled crust. Place plastic wrap directly on the warm filling and chill in the
            refrigerator until set, 8 to 24 hours. </li>
        <li>Prepare topping: Beat heavy cream and vanilla at medium-high speed with an electric mixer until foamy.
            Gradually add 3 tablespoons sugar, beating until soft peaks form. </li>
        <li>Just before serving, top pie with whipped cream. </li>
    </ol>
